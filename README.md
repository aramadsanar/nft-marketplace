# Design
This app is written in a la MVVM style, where the business logic is separated from the GUI code and repetitive/reusable GUI code are stored into its own component.

- Business logic code is written in ./view_models
- GUI code is written in ./pages
- Components are written in ./components

Only export states and functions from view model that are used by GUI code, otherwise, prepend the function name with underscore ```_``` to mark it as private
